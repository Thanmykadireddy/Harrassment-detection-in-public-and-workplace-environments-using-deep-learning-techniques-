# Harrassment-detection-in-public-and-workplace-environments-using-deep-learning-techniques-
Developed a CNN-based model for detecting harassment which uses the dataset contains an equal  split of harassment and normal healthy environment  images, with an 80:20 training-to-testing ratio. It could detect harassment in real-time, by which I  aim to create a safer environment and do early  detection and prevention.
